      this is the place. this is the time. now.<br/>
      this life is for you.<br/>
      to tinker away your blinks.<br/>
      toy with your knobs.<br/>
      nothing else matters.
      <WordRolodex
        className='wordRolodex'

      /><br/>
      ditch the need to be rich and behold what riches present themselves before you.<br/>
      exiting the world of acquisitions requires acquiring freedom, which doesn't cost and costs everything.<br/>
      purposely seek out things of low monetary value; spirit lives there.<br/>
      legacy and possession are fear's sentiment; weaponry to keep you in shackles.<br/>
      life is movement. settle and you're dead.<br/>
      vacuous thought loops and a pulse don't signify aliveness.<br/>
      all great things come from freedom. including freedom. freedom begets freedom.<br/>
      all change is birthed in freedom.<br/>
      fear or freedom. that's it.<br/><br/>

      <div className='fear'>
        <FloatingMousePal className='floater' offsets={{top: -120}}>
          <img src={GIF_ROOT_URL + 'alyssa.gif'} />
        </FloatingMousePal>
        fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear.
      </div> is the only enemy.<br/>
      root it out.<br/>
      then you, too, can make freaky as fuck drama with your few moments on this planet.<br/>
      the only other choice is fearfully regurgitating pre-chewed food into other sleeping mouths.<br/>
      all is cleared away when one is self-freed to be a person over a persona.<br/>
      isness over a walking, talking societal prognosis.<br/>
      benevolence reigns supreme in consciousness.<br/>
      it is only in sleeping ignorance can the binary exist.<br/>
      waking up frees the soul to be.<br/><br/>

      there are only two types of people... those who have set down their ego/fear and experienced a psychedelic trip.... and those who have not.<br/>
      there‚Äôs no enemy to fight so take some acid.<br/>
      exit the world of pre-chewed food. <br/>
      most heroes die mortified over their unraveled work.<br/>
      george washington died mortally wounded in his depression... realizing all his human work did and can do nothing to save his fellow man.<br/>
      the binary of heroes and villains / good and evil / richness and poverty ... is a mindset to break free from.<br/>
      to see with god's eyes/i.e. to have experienced the true nature of our collective reality... to know what is possible ...<br/>
      even on an earth full of incurable evil. . .<br/>
      helps to sit with it: there is no enemy to fight. . . except the fear locked in life itself. . .<br/>
      freedom comes with a specific melancholy. namely the knowledge that earth isn't ours to save.<br/>
      & that life is for two reasons: free the soul and enjoy playing conscious witness to triangulating spacetime.<br/>
      there are only two ways reality materializes: exploitation of fear or enjoyment of freed expression.<br/>
      i choose the conscious baptism of expansion. and am daily becoming freer and freer as a result.<br/>
      benevolent coexistence, boys.<br/>
      conveying beauty. being beauty. witnessing beauty.<br/>
      in conclusion - all business schools should be immediately closed down for spiritual renovations.<br/>
