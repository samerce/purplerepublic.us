          this is the place. this is the time. now.<br/>
          this life is for you.<br/>
          to tinker away your blinks.<br/>
          toy with your knobs.<br/>
          nothing else matters.<br/>
          not money, not memories, not lovers, not children, not health, not trump.<br/>
          ditch the need to be rich and behold what riches present themselves before you.<br/>
          exiting the world of acquisitions requires acquiring freedom, which doesn't cost.<br/>
          purposely seek out things of low monetary value; spirit lives there.<br/>
          legacy and possession are fear's sentiment; weaponry to keep you in shackles.<br/>
          life is movement. settle and you're dead.<br/>
          vacuous thought loops and a pulse don't signify aliveness.<br/>
          all great things come from freedom. including freedom. freedom begets freedom.<br/>
          all change is birthed in freedom.<br/>
          fear or freedom. that's it.<br/><br/>

          fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear. is the only enemy.<br/>
          root it out.<br/>
          then you, too, can make freaky as fuck drama with your few moments on this planet.<br/>
          the only other choice is fearfully regurgitating pre-chewed food into other sleeping mouths.<br/>
          all is cleared away when one is self-freed to be a person over a persona.<br/>
          isness over a walking, talking societal prognosis.<br/>
          benevolence reigns supreme in consciousness.<br/>
          it is only in sleeping ignorance can the binary exist.<br/>
          waking up frees the soul to be.<br/><br/>

          there are only two types of people... those who have set down their ego/fear and experienced a psychedelic trip.... and those who have not.<br/>
          thereâ€™s no enemy to fight so take some acid.<br/>
          exit the world of pre-chewed food. <br/>
          most heroes die mortified over their unraveled work.<br/>
          george washington died mortally wounded in his depression... realizing all his human work did and can do nothing to save his fellow man.<br/>
          the binary of heroes and villains / good and evil / richness and poverty ... is a mindset to break free from.<br/>
          to see with god's eyes/i.e. to have experienced the true nature of our collective reality... to know what is possible ...<br/>
          even on an earth full of incurable evil. . .<br/>
          helps to sit with it: there is no enemy to fight. . . except the fear locked in life itself. . .<br/>
          freedom comes with a specific melancholy. namely the knowledge that earth isn't ours to save.<br/>
          & that life is for two reasons: free the soul and enjoy playing conscious witness to triangulating spacetime.<br/>
          there are only two ways reality materializes: exploitation of fear or enjoyment of freed expression.<br/>
          i choose the conscious baptism of expansion. and am daily becoming freer and freer as a result.<br/>
          benevolent coexistence, boys.<br/>
          conveying beauty. being beauty. witnessing beauty.<br/>
          in conclusion - all business schools should be immediately closed down for spiritual renovations.<br/>
