"don’t you know anyone with hope in their hearts?"
“no.”

insufficient quench. mother, i thirst to escape life’s drudgery. stories and ideas and people and adventure.

mystic social prophet. biocentric idealist. parnassus is-ness poet punching above my weight.
genius or fraud as if it matters to the curation.
i just want an adderall prescription. gangly at 40 isn't as cute.

boldly natural over robust caricaturing. the plight of the artist is the privilege to starve. it is my right. go to the gutter. the game can’t be beat. but the brink is a principled fight. i won’t work. how i earn my daily bread will not be work. a remote martyr’d saint.

a happily sad soul willfully flung against a gray world of gloom.  it won’t be ennobling. privacies of the heart reveal the worst. a life of irrationally budgeted extravagances justified as art. no moral defenses are to be made.

mostly she’s beautiful and open,
like a flower sprung in june. 
sometimes she’s closed and ugly,
but winter's needed for the bloom


winter of the mind
long and merciless
tread lighter

the eternal quest of the hedonic treadmill

lost. sad. confused. alone. bored. mad. full of pain. and hate. little and afraid. trapped, strangled and desperate. but also free. a joyous happy spirit. rebellious, open and kind. pure love confronting a hard world that is lonely & shadowed, in perpetual pain.

darkness everywhere. joy and light everywhere. the raging range—dark and black and lost. clean and saved and perfect.

possessed, obsessed, thoroughly pursuing an ideal. it never ceases, there is no break, a rich, complete enjoyment—art, war, thought, metaphysical realms. a thorough penetration. an aliveness. a discussion of anything. all tangents and some wine.

 what is poetry in an age of decline ‘cept capturing the fall?

a man who makes potions in life's traveling show.

III. disparate monologues of a thing-seeker. unpolished and sloppy and sometimes don't get all the poop off my ass when i wipe. sometimes all i can do is pity myself and masturbate. cry and drink wine before noon. sometimes i can't get footing. can't shake the shakiness it's all built on. the competition between glass houses that ain’t bulletproof. a giant heart steamrolled by an even bigger ego. a brain that never got enough of the right kind of love in childhood. i know my life has one finish line. and it isn’t a linear path. and i’m already dead if i’m in my head.

IX. desolate insides, a menacing landscape. walk that endless highway towards the horizon kid. the nectar of the gods is in my belly. slept with the virgin mary, the demons are wrestled, buddha in my nostril flare. a demure flirtation. tinker with your universe. but you have to feel it, spirit has to want to come home. this isn’t something you can sell or convince people of; it’s a very solo journey. i didn't know this happy was possible. acceptance and curiosity. i am safe. i am home. i am eternal. giving up the struggle is scary. new truths don’t disrupt your nature’s story. just provides continuity’s lube. the theory of black holes crumble close to the event horizon.

i require so little from humanity. having taken to paving my own luck. the amnesia of living seemed to have misplaced yesterday's true so i've taken to aimless strolling. accommodate or isolate so i choose charcoal sketching in my truck. sitting curbside staring at ants. apparently the pleasant passing of time in the front seat of an SUV feels lurky. irrational and suspicious. my white youth mostly saves me from the hate. well isn't he a queer queer. i'll just hide in my car under the $50k until things start making sense. but this ain't life's last poem cuz my head don't want no oven. bad sylvia.

emotionally lethargic.

impotent against myself— incorrigible. disposable. utterly defenseless.

desolate angel of thoughtful repose, you are alone tonight. a mind muddled by better men. a very lardy pig consumed by a dim, drab waking life from which there isn’t room to recover.

riddled with yards of the world’s intestines - dazed and embittered by her abuses, drunk with her parfumery.

turned on by roses cuz they wilt but mad cuz everything’s always alright.

a homely, prosey girl.

the deplorables are in vogue again. but european residence must wait until after mother dies. the trauma of receiving news of her faulty heart while in hong kong is too much to repeat. i must be a drive away from her now. two hours to sisters and nineteen speedy hours to florida, the two places she now keeps herself. my calls are infrequent and visits far less so, but at least i am in her country.

i'm a crying man, but these are crying times.
tear-stained crier, unmendably torn yet unabsolved from ‘soul under construction.'
salivating for salvation in laughter that comes easy. unforced smile of an upturned lip. some clumsy goofing.
 how did i get this empty? is the sine wave skyward—am i filling up? where is life headed?

i’m early. plight of an eager spirit.

i avoid the world. i'm not used to being avoided. thanks for the experience.

all is something else until it is known as something else. knowledge reveals different truths. 

the mind controls the body because it is the body. sophisticated but predictable clockwork. mental mechanics are still mechanics. mechanical process covers all occupation of space which is to say everything. which is to say nature is a fixed machine doing as it does. our screaming at nature, pulling it about, demanding it operate how we like, is just nature being nature. that is not separate from the process. this thing we call ego is further mechanics of nature. sense receptors noticing stimulus is mechanics of nature. making decisions, feeling scared or loved is mechanics of nature. nature does not change but it does behave according to the stimulus it focuses on. 

nostic, knowing versus agnostic, not knowing.

over-rationalization has pushed out space for beauty. 

beauty exists self-so, further mechanics of nature. 

what happens if tomorrow everyone stops thinking and there is a systemic switch from analysis to observation, to witnessing is-ness. 

and this opened space to freely expressing the mechanics of nature without so much focus on we as humans dictating the process. instead we are filters to project all-things immutable.  

to say there would be more beauty with less survivalist thought is to say there would be more non-egoic demand on what this beauty should or ought look like. 

when does thought become overthought and therefore less beautiful?

and what is thought? how is it separate from knowledge? 

the thinker attributes motives and actions to his rational thought, to the methodical processes leading to what he emotes. and attributes actions of the non-thinker, the human animal, to the mechanical process of nature. a man does what he does because a leaf, table, or billy goat do what they do.

it is a game of language and symbol. existence is a play on what this symbolic language stands for. if you know the color yellow you can more likely draw a sun when asked by your teacher. however, if the word yellow connotes nothing in your brain but a funny sound then you are less likely to complete the task. failure to draw the sun says something about you. about the intelligence of your nature. and how you should fit within society. 

i doubt therefore i think therefore i am versus i think therefore i am versus i feel therefore i am versus i am therefore i am. 

how can will move my index finger? how does the sense perception inside my brain upon seeing a flashing light register sensations throughout my body? and what of the way it makes me feel and how it makes me think? 

all phenomenon is nature focusing itself.`
